# Portfolio - Mark Wilson

This weeks homework required us to create a portfolio website and deploy it with github pages. The website needed to have 3 pages: 
index.html (About me)
portfolio.html (Portfolio)
contact.html (Contact)

All three pages must have a consistent navbar and be mobile responsive. Creating responsive layouts was done using Bootstraps external css linked to out website. External Javascript was also required to make the menu system functional.

The styling of each page is done by creating and linking the style.css stylesheet. But before linking that it is important to link reset.css style sheet to make sure the look is consistent across browsers.
