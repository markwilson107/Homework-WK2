# Portfolio - Mark Wilson
A single page portfolio projecting containing links to all my work and information about me including how I can be contacted.
The website uses JQuery to create auto scroll effects as well as fade in effects. The styling is done by linking bootstrap.css and using style.css for my own customization and styling.
